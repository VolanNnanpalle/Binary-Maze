# Binary Maze
Allow the user to input the row and column of a binary maze. 
Then the user can input the binary maze where the walls are 1's, 
open paths are 0's, entrance is b and the exit is e. This program 
solves for all the possible solutions of the maze by using 
Recursive BackTracking. Then places p's on the solution paths 
and outputs all possible solutions to the console.
